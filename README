Coarse-grain models of HIV-1 nucleoids

These programs are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Four programs are included in this release, which together
model the mature HIV-1 nucleoid, using this five-step pipeline:
1) quasisymmetry.f -- creates a lattice of points on a sphere that
   correspond to the locations of gag proteins in the immature
   HIV-1 virion
2) rnapath.f -- performs a self-avoiding random walk on this lattice,
   generating the path of two HIV-1 gRNA strands.
3) condense.f -- in a short optimization run, is used to relax
   the RNA path based on a 3 nt/bead coarse-grain model.
4) makeconstraints.f -- assigns the location of integrase and
   nucleocapsid proteins, based on a list of experimental
   localizations and choosing integrase sites that are in
   proximity from step (3).
5) condense.f -- condenses the nucleoid incorporating integrase and
   nucleocapsid localizations and user-defined secondary structure
   constraints.

The result is a PDB-format file that may be read by most molecular
graphics programs. The PDB format is modified in the following ways:
--coordinates are in nanometers
--RNA strands have atom name "P" and residue name "RNA"
--integrase subunits have atom name "CA" and residue name "IN"
--nucleocapsid subunits have atom name "N", and residue names
  "NCO" for experimentally-observed positions and
  "NCR" for randomly-placed positions
Suggested radii for visualization: RNA=0.5, NC=1.5, IN=2.5

The script JSmol.script will create a customized view with appropriate radii,
using JSmol. 

Compile the programs:
gfortran quasisymmetry.f -o quasisymmetry
gfortran rnapath.f -o rnapath
gfortran makeconstraints.f -o makeconstraints
gfortran condense.f -o condense

The programs and pipeline require several input data files:
icos.mat      matrices for icosahedral symmetry
Tlattice.pdb  coordinates for quasisymmetrical tiling
inpeaks.dat   experimental integrase binding sites
ncpeaks.dat   experimental nucleocapsid binding sites
5UTR.const    constraint file for secondary structure in the 5'UTR

The programs may be run individually, reading input commands
from Unit 5, or from a command file, such as:
./condense < condense.inp > condense.log     (log file is optional)

The script file HIVnucleoid.script will run a full pipeline to generate
a nucleoid model with integrase tetramers.
./HIVnucleoid.script > HIVnucleoid.log     (log file is optional)
On typical desktop hardware, this will require about 1/2 hour.

The script file HIVnucleoid_3types.script will run a pipeline to
generate three models: with tetramers, dimers, or no integrase.

Brief descriptions of input parameters for each program are included
in the program headers, and more information is available at:
http://ccsb.scripps.edu/latticenucleoid/HIVnucleoid

Please note that these programs were created to explore a specific
application, and are not designed for generalized use. They have
very little error checking, so large changes in input parameters
will be expected to lead to spurious results or program crashes.
